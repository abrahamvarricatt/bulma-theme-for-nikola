Sophisticated, simple, and classically styled, Libretto is designed to showcase
your writing prowess! A unique feature of this theme is that it does NOT rely
on any Javascript. It's built using HTML, CSS and a few fonts.

This is my first effort at making a theme and I hope you will enjoy using it!

The source code for this theme is hosted on Github. You can find it at the

When creating your own site with this theme, it may benefit you to have a peek
at the `conf.py` file that I used for reference. It can be found here,

This theme is based off a Wordpress theme of the same name. You can find the
original inspiration here,

Speaking of original inspirations, I needed some dummy posts to work with
during theme development. For this purpose I visited the Wikipedia page for the
Wheel of Time series and copy-pasted from the different links. Don't worry,
there are no spoilers on this demo site. Just the names of the books as titles
and their publication dates as, well, publication dates for blog posts!
