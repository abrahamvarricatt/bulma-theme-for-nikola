Among The Wheel of Time books, The Dragon Reborn was unique at the time in
that it only had a handful of chapters told from Rand al'Thor's point of view.
Instead, nearly all chapters are told from the perspectives of his friends and
allies as they race to catch up to him and help him. This is unusual: Rand is
the protagonist of the series and, as the Dragon Reborn, he is the title
character of this book. However, although few chapters are told from his
point of view, his presence in the plot is ubiquitous; all major characters
in the book are either trying to help him or are working against him.
