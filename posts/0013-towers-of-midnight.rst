.. TEASER_END

The novel is the second part of A Memory of Light, Robert Jordan's projected
final book. Because of the amount of material to cover, it was agreed by
Jordan's wife, Tor Books and Brandon Sanderson to break the final book into
three separate books. All three books are written by Sanderson with the aid of
extensive notes left by the late Jordan.[5] The title Towers of Midnight was
proposed by Sanderson, replacing the working title of A Memory of Light:
Shifting Winds.[4] It was released on November 2, 2010[1][2] and is composed
of 328,000 words.[6][7] The book debuted at #1 on The New York Times Best
Seller list. [8] The novel consists of a prologue, 57 chapters, and an
epilogue.
