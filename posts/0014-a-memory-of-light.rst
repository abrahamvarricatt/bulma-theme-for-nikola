A Memory of Light is the 14th and final book of the fantasy series The Wheel
of Time, written by American authors Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson,

April 8, 2013.[2] The book reached No. 1 on several bestsellers lists.

The title A Memory of Light was previously intended to apply to a book
containing the material in what are now books 12, 13 and 14.[5] The original
book was incomplete at the time of Jordan's death on September 16, 2007, from
cardiac amyloidosis;[6] his widow Harriet McDougal and publisher Tom Doherty
chose to publish the book posthumously. Tor Books announced that Brandon
Sanderson had been chosen to finish writing the book.

The unfinished book was split into three volumes because it was believed a
single volume would be too large to print.[8] Initially it was planned that all
three would be titled A Memory of Light, with distinct subtitles; eventually
this plan was dropped, and the three volumes were titled The Gathering Storm
(published October 27, 2009), Towers of Midnight (published November 2, 2010),
and A Memory of Light (published January 8, 2013).
