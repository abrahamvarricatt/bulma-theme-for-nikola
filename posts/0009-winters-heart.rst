The book's title is a reference to the increasing coldness of Rand al'Thor's
personality and to the return of winter following the reversal in the previous
book, The Path of Daggers, of the unnatural heat caused by the Dark One's
manipulation of climate.

Winter's Heart was the first Wheel of Time book for which the prologue,
entitled "Snow", was first sold as an ebook in advance of the physical
release of the book. "Snow" was released by the Scribner imprint of Simon &
Schuster in September 2000, two months before the publication of Winter's
Heart.
